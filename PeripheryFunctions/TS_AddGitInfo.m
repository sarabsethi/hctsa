function gitInfo = getGitInfo()
    % Get information about the Git repository in the current directory, including:
    %          - branch name of the current Git Repo
    %          -Git SHA1 HASH of the most recent commit
    %          -url of corresponding remote repository, if one exists
    %
    % The function first checks to see if a .git/ directory is present. If so it
    % reads the .git/HEAD file to identify the branch name and then it looks up
    % the corresponding commit.
    %
    % It then reads the .git/config file to find out the url of the
    % corresponding remote repository. This is all stored in a gitInfo struct.
    %
    % Note this uses only file information, it makes no external program
    % calls at all.
    %
    % This function must be in the base directory of the git repository
